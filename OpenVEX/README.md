# OpenVEX

[OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex) is a project to build a simple, embeddable
implementation of the
[Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/minimum-requirements-vulnerability-exploitability-exchange-vex). VEX allows
projects, companies, researches and others to communicate the effect of a
vulnerability on software.

OpenVEX documents are designed to be self sustaining, but
[the specification is designed to benefit from the in-toto attestation format](https://github.com/openvex/spec/blob/main/ATTESTING.md) completing VEX statements with data
outside of the OpenVEX predicate.

The project is incubating under the Open Source Security Foundation's 
[Vulnerability Disclosures WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures),
has its own [Special Interest Group](https://github.com/ossf/OpenVEX) and holds
regular meetings where everybody is welcome!
